          <p>
            First, to make things clear, I am not claiming that people should be disrespected or
            mistreated because of their beliefs. Nor am I claiming that my beliefs will always be
            superior, or that a certain set of beliefs must absolutely be the 'correct way'. What I will
            say is that beliefs drive our very words and actions, and thus, we should always examine
            these beliefs to ensure that we have a solid foundation that makes our lives, and hopefully
            society as a whole, a better place to live in.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most tangible and obvious examples of how beliefs impact everyday life would be
            regarding food. What we believe about food, from nutrition, price, taste, and environmental
            impact, tempered by how we prioritize these aspects, affects our diet tremendously. Of
            course, the topic of religion is one that is so inherently offensive that it's no wonder
            that this topic is often avoided. As Christians, this is even more pointedly so, considering
            just how diverse the beliefs can be across a broad spectrum of the Christian population.
            Here's a quick refresher on the basic tenets of Christianity: We have all sinned and became
            separated from God. Only be accepting Jesus can we reconnect with God and enjoy eternal
            life. Before I became Christian, the inference of this message was that if I didn't believe
            what Christians believed, I'd be going to Hell to suffer eternal torment. While I dare not
            claim to be an authority on other religions, it should be obvious to anyone that this is
            inherently incompatible, even offensive, to anyone with a non-Christian set of beliefs.
            Likewise, if you were to ask me to be honest, I'm afraid that I'd have to say that frankly,
            many people's beliefs are quite offensive as well. Yet here we are, coexisting relatively
            peacefully.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me, the danger lies in attacking the person for their beliefs. Another one of the
            foundations of Christian belief is to love others, and this includes those who don't share
            our beliefs. Taken to its extreme, this means that we show love even if those who disagree
            with us will never be won over to our side. For myself, and probably for many other people,
            it's just natural to bash that type of person. Think of racists, it's far too easy to
            dehumanize and caricaturize these people are below trash, and assault them as thus. It's far
            more challenging to treat them with respect, even if we abhor their values, knowing full
            well that there is a chance they may never come to see things our way. Why did I decide to
            start this website? I believe that perhaps I can share some useful food for thought that
            will help people live better lives. Whether you're Christian or not, and whether you agree
            with my beliefs or not, I urge you, dear reader, to be respectful of people and embrace
            civility.

          <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a
            globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which
            there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals.
            The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

          <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning
            back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

          <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set
            eye on the earth.</p>

          <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her
            protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not
            help but love and cherish her.</p>

          <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the
            experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more
            valuable than those which divide us.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a
            task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of
            just beginning.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.
            Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the
            next ten.</blockquote>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a
            historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a
            marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so
            delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a
            man.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to
            explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone
            before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth
            to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
