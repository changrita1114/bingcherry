          <p>
            First, to make things clear, I am not claiming that people should be disrespected or mistreated because of
            their beliefs. Nor am I claiming that my beliefs will always be superior, or that a certain set of beliefs
            must absolutely be the 'correct way'. What I will say is that beliefs drive our very words and actions, and
            thus, we should always examine these beliefs to ensure that we have a solid foundation that reflects the
            values of Jesus. In fact, by saying that our values should reflect the values of Jesus, I am already being
            offensive to a large section of the population.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jesus is one of the most tangible and obvious examples of how beliefs created an impact. He was either
            accepted as the Son of God or considered the most terrible of blasphemers depending on what people believed.
            Of course, the topic of religion is one that is so inherently offensive that it's no wonder that this is
            often avoided. Here's a quick refresher on the basic tenets of Christianity: We have all sinned and become
            separated from God. Only by accepting Jesus can we reconnect with God and enjoy eternal life. Before I
            became Christian, the inference of this message was that if I didn't believe what Christians believed, I'd
            be going to Hell to suffer eternal torment. While I dare not claim to be an authority on other religions, it
            should be obvious to anyone that this is inherently incompatible, even offensive, to anyone with a
            non-Christian set of beliefs. Likewise, if you were to ask me to be honest, I'm afraid that many
            non-Christian beliefs are utterly offensive to me, so much so that I'd rather the people who believe them
            repudiate them completely and embrace my own beliefs! Yet here we are, coexisting relatively peacefully.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me, the danger lies in attacking the person for their beliefs. Jesus was certainly no stranger to
            attacks of all kinds. This is where we need to remember that another one of the foundations of Christian
            belief is to love others, and this includes those who don't share our beliefs. Taken to its extreme, this
            means that we show love even if those who disagree with us will never be won over to our side. For myself,
            and probably for many other people, it's just natural to bash the type of person with beliefs considered
            offensive. Think of racists, it's far too easy to dehumanize and caricaturize these people as below trash,
            and assault them as thus. It's far more challenging to treat them with respect, even if we abhor their
            values, knowing full well that there is a chance they may never come to see things our way. Even among
            fellow Christians there are a myriad of views that may clash with each other, and if being graceful to
            non-Christians was hard, it appears that grace among fellow Christians is in even shorter supply.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why did I decide to start this website? I believe that perhaps I can share some useful food for thought that
            will help people live better lives. Whether you're Christian or not, and whether you agree with my beliefs
            or not, I urge you, dear reader, to be respectful of people and embrace civility. Hopefully, we'll find that
            even though some beliefs are utterly detestable (and perhaps, rightfully so), we can still show honor to the
            ones espousing them. I write this to serve as a reminder to myself just as much as all other people.

          <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a
            globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which
            there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals.
            The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

          <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning
            back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

          <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set
            eye on the earth.</p>

          <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her
            protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not
            help but love and cherish her.</p>

          <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the
            experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more
            valuable than those which divide us.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a
            task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of
            just beginning.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.
            Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the
            next ten.</blockquote>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a
            historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a
            marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so
            delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a
            man.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to
            explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone
            before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth
            to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
