                        Recently, I've discovered the fun of filling out online surveys. The monetary rewards are
                        terrible, but if you think of it as a recreational activity that actually gives, as opposed to
                        takes away your money, it's a decent past time. Naturally, a decent portion of them will ask
                        about my political views, and I'll always answer 'Moderate' and 'Independent'. I cannot claim
                        that my political views are definitely the ideal and perfect path to follow, but I do feel that
                        there is some biblical basis for this:
                        “It is good to grasp the one and not let go of the other. Whoever fears God will avoid all
                        extremes.” Ecc 7:18.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moderation certainly makes sense in other areas of our lives. Everyone is familiar with how
                        terrible an overly sedentary lifestyle is to our health, while over-exercise leads to it's own
                        fair share of problems. Water is essential to our lives, yet over-drinking leads to water
                        poisoning, and there are those who go to such extremes with sodium avoidance that they end up
                        with sodium deficiency. Given how little sodium our body needs, and how easy it is to consume it
                        without realizing, I'm actually sincerely impressed by anyone who'd go to that level of extreme
                        to avoid it. Dear reader, you're certainly welcome to disagree with me on this point, but at
                        least from my perspective, one who goes to extremes is quite vulnerable to a type of idolatry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We need to look no further than the recent attack on the capital on January 6th for examples of
                        what happens when extremism goes too far. To paraphrase Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse, politics
                        isn't the weird worship of one dude. I'd like people to keep in mind that over 90% of the time,
                        this same Ben Sasse had voted in support of Trump's measures, yet even he recognizes when to
                        call a spade a spade, despite that spade being on the same team. That's part of the danger of
                        extremism, you end up so devoted to 'your side' that you're unable to recognize the flaws that
                        exist. I remember during one of my pastor's sermon that he said that some people have so much
                        faith in politics that they believe things will all work out if their side wins, or that the
                        world will be doomed when the other side wins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “When any Israelite sets up idols in his heart and puts a wicked stumbling block before his
                        face, and then comes to the prophet, I the Lord will answer him according his great idolatry.”
                        Eze 4:3. I was wondering about all the notable Christian prophets who had prophesied that Trump
                        would win the election. Of course, to the best of my memory, no matter what the polls say I've
                        only ever heard prophets proclaim that the Republican candidate would win, and it's not as
                        though they have been wrong every time. Yet God's word is supposed to be unfailing, so if
                        someone claiming to speak for God says things that don't come to pass, that verse from Ezekiel
                        always pops into my head. As Christians, we should always be vigilante against allowing idols
                        fall into our hearts, especially not when we're about to proclaim something that is supposed to
                        be from God.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There's a common theme ongoing in all threads of extremism, a devotion to some idea that
                        dominates our life. Going back to the sodium example, there are some incredible lengths one must
                        go to in order to avoid sodium at a level that'd result in a medical problem. I've spoken with a
                        person who let sports take over so much of their life that they actually ended up with several
                        health problems directly resulting from their overexertion. In other words, this extremism led
                        to a form of idolatry. There is one exception I'd like to make regarding extremism though, and
                        that's with regards to God. Although that's another rabbit hole with it's own set of arguments
                        that I won't get into here.
