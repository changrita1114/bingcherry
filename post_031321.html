          <p>
            Anytime someone asks me if I considered myself to be religious, I have to pause to think about this. Having
            grown up as in a non-Christian background, I tended to associate religion in general to be a a nebulous
            concept that had no practical purpose in my life. Christians, especially, were the worst of the lot. At
            least on TV, I always had the impression that Christians were self-righteous religious freaks who were
            constantly condemning other people's ways when they didn't live up to the standards of Christian morality. A
            non-Christian co-worker of mine once described religion as an intangible concept that couldn't be proven
            either way, while I recall one of the pastor's at my church said that when he uses the term 'religious', he
            means in a pejorative way. In a previous article, I warned about extremism, except in the case of God, yet
            here I am bashing religiosity. I do believe there's a huge difference between two. While it's good to pursue
            the former to the extreme, the latter is dangerous even in moderation.
          </p>
          <p>
            For anyone who is somewhat familiar with Christian faith, we are reminded of Revelations 3:16 .“So, because
            you are lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, I am about to spit you out of my mouth.” Clearly God is saying that
            moderation is not a desirable path to take. I think that in order to put this in the right context though,
            we need to think back to God's commandments, which can be summed up as 'love God and love others as you
            would yourself.' If you look at it in this manner, going to the extremes to love God and our fellow humans
            represents something very different from what the typical religious extremists do. When you see people who
            dedicate their very being into helping the poor, the sick, and the brokenhearted, it's hard to have a harsh
            word for their actions, though I'm sure there are still plenty of detractors. Yet when you hear of religious
            extremists, we typically think of oppressive rules, violence, and general suppression of those they consider
            to be different, it's even harder to find words to support such actions. The difference should be obvious
            though, Godly extremism is borne out of going to extreme lengths to live out the tenants of love, while
            religious extremism is borne out of going to extreme lengths to live out the religious rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hear Christians talk all the time about 'justification by faith', yet in practice many Christians still
            go to extremes to force the justification by law not only on themselves, but even on non-believers. Some
            obvious examples include the issue of homosexuality and abortion. The vast majority of Christians interpret
            the Bible to say that these are against God's laws. The problem arises when Christian groups put far too
            much energy into pushing laws against the homosexuals and people getting abortion that they forget the
            higher law of God to love others. Put another way, outlawing homosexual marriage and abortion may seem like
            a good way of forcing God's laws into everyday life, but in terms of actually helping people in these
            situations, these laws are worthless and more than likely drive people away from God's grace. Of course, I
            realize this position is probably a bad one for both other Christians and non-Christians to accept. With
            regards to homosexual marriage, for example, I am against it personally but believe that we should not have
            laws outlawing it among non-Christians. If I were a politician I'd end up losing the votes of both
            Republicans and Democrats for such a view.

            “For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the
            cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.”
            Ephesians 6:12. This is the danger of the current 'Culture War' mentality in modern day Christianity. Yes,
            it is easy to target the non-Christians and demonize them for pushing values counter to God, but then we are
            merely wrestling against flesh and blood. We know the true enemies are the dark spiritual forces behind
            those who don't know God, so why are we using human ways and political action to fight them? Even a secular
            person will tell you that you won't win people to your side by forcing your rules on them, and even less so
            if you are painting them to be your enemy. Even voting pro-Christian politicians into power won't save
            things, only Jesus can do that, so why do so many Christians put so much faith into fallible humans? Think
            about Galatians 5:22-23. “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness,
            faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.” How do people develop
            fruits of the Spirit through religious extremism? It seems like Godly extremism, or going to the extreme to
            love people, especially those we don't agree with, is the path that leads to good fruit.
