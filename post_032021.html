            I did not grow up in a Christian environment. I've met non-Christians who have said to me that they didn't
            believe anything without evidence, and I can completely relate their perspective because I am one of them.
            What I've come to realize is that nobody believes something without evidence. Evidence comes from many
            sources, such as news, family, friends, TV, and whatever information we see and hear. The distinction is
            that we interpret evidence differently, and this becomes reflected in the beliefs we adapt. I did not grow
            up in a Christian family, and in my youth, all the evidence presented to me regarding Christianity was
            interpreted to mean that this entire concept was false.

            All of this changed, however, when I went to Taiwan at the age of 24. I had a cousin there who had been
            going to church along with his girlfriend. I knew that he had started going to church when he was around 10
            years old, when his father (my uncle) passed away from cancer. Now he has always struck me as a very logical
            person, so in my own mind, I thought that this was a classic example of the church preying on vulnerable
            people in order to spread religion to people. However, what I found out was something quite to the contrary.
            Indeed, as a very rational and logical minded person, my cousin stopped going to church in his teens when he
            began questioning the dogma of the Sunday sermons. He had trouble believing that this 'God' would speak to
            people, and felt that the miracles described in the Bible were exaggerations of some likely easily explained
            scientific phenomenon. Yet the story he would describe tell me was simply too incredible to ignore.
          </p>
          <p>
            About a year or two ago, my cousin had felt lost and directionless. While he never cared for his pastor's
            religious teaching, he nonetheless felt that the pastor was a wise man who could provide him with some life
            coaching. One evening, he went to visit the pastor's apartment on a whim, only to be met by the pastor's
            youngest son, age 12 at the time and the only person there. To my cousin's shock, not only did the boy know
            his purpose for visiting, he also knew the questions he intended to ask the pastor. When my cousin asked how
            he knew these things, the boy simply answered that God had told him. In his mind, my cousin thought to
            himself “If God is really speaking to this boy, I want Him to tell the boy to shake my hand.” The next
            moment, the boy took my cousin's right hand and started shaking it. Still a bit shaken, my cousin thought
            “If God is really really doing this, please tell the boy to shake my left hand.” Moments later, the boy
            stretched out his left hand and looked at my cousin, saying “didn't you want to shake my left hand?” My
            cousin rededicated himself to God that night and hasn't looked back since.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for me, even knowing deep down that my cousin certainly was telling the truth of his encounter, I didn't
            immediately believe. Regardless of how amazing the story sounded, it was still second hand knowledge and
            felt impersonal to me. However, I decided to be more open minded about this Christ myself and started
            attending church regularly, seeking answers for myself. Indeed, there were many unique instances that
            further reinforced two fundamental cores of my faith today: That God is very real, and that God truly loves
            us. I would hear testimony of people being miraculously healed, broken families reconciling, and met near
            strangers who could know certain things about me that they would've only known if God had told them Himself.
            I ultimately decided to get baptized the following year, in April of 2004. The day before the baptism, we
            had a prayer meeting during which I prayed to God that I truly believed. When one of the pastors laid their
            hands on me, I felt an incredible surge of peace and warmth surge through my body. My interpretation of this
            event was that God definitely is real.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, there have been numerous other events, experienced both firsthand and secondhand, that have only
            strengthened my faith in both God's existence and in His love. Now I understand that how each person
            interprets these experiences will vary, and that's fine. We are going to come across all sorts of
            information in our lives, and it's good to examine each piece critically and with an open mind. I would hope
            that those who do so would reach the same conclusion as me, but at the same time I have learned to be more
            tolerant of those who don't. I believe that maybe this world would be a more peaceful place if we all
            learned likewise.
