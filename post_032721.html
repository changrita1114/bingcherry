            There was recently an amusing piece of news from Taiwan about a sushi restaurant in Taiwan offering free,
            all you can eat sushi to people with the characters 'gui yu', or 'salmon', in their name. In Taiwan, the
            cost of changing your name is $3 and each person can change their name a maximum of 3 times in their
            lifetime, leading to chaos as a large multitude did exactly that in order to take advantage of this
            promotion. This made me think about the importance of names from a broader perspective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Obviously, the Bible is full of numerous examples of names and their significance. Jehovah Rapha, Elohim,
            Yahweh are just a few of God's names. Then there are the famous name changes, such as Abram becoming
            Abraham, Sarai becoming Sarah, and Jacob becoming Israel. Each name change carried with it a change in the
            entire identity of individual. Then we get into the names of people groups, Israelites, Midianites, Romans,
            Egyptians, Babylonians, etc... We can see how names create identities. On the other hand, the abuse of names
            carries with it terrible consequences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Matthew 5:22 "But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment.
            Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca,’ is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‘You
            fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell." It is logical to say that if insulting someone is considered
            a terrible sin, using insulting names would not be viewed favorably by Jesus either. You'll hear of people
            using words such as 'libs' 'cons', 'libtards', or 'conservaturds' to describe those whose views they
            disagree with. Then there's the slew of derogatory racial epiphets that I will not be mentioning here. We
            Christians often talk about how the ways of the world poison our mind and soul, and a culture of insults and
            name-calling would certainly be part of this poison. When we devalue humans with insulting names, we are
            falling down a dark path.
          </p>
          <p>
            I dare not claim myself innocent of this crime, so these words are as much an exhortion to myself as it is
            to others, in order to remind all people of the dangers of misusing names and words. I would also urge
            people to be wary of any public figures who resort to insults and name-calling in general, as their words
            are promoting murder and endangering those who embrace their ways into the fires of hell. Instead, why not
            put our words into encouragement and good?
