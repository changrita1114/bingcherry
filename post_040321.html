          <p>
            Yesterday, I visited a friend of mine who happened to be a bunny owner. Now bunnies are incredibly adorable
            animals, everything from their long ears down to their adorable cotton ball shaped tail is endearing to us.
            Yet they are also incredibly skittish creatures, easily frightened by everything else that moves. My
            friend's bunny was terribly frightened by my precense, and it took a while for it to even approach me to eat
            a treat out of my hand. You can't blame them for this, of course. As prey animals, there are so many enemies
            out there in nature waiting to make a meal out of them, so it's easily understandable that my friend's pet
            would be so apprehensive towards someone who meant it absolutely no harm.
          </p>
          <p>
            As apex predators in the food chain, we humans are literally our own worst enemy, with mosquitoes at second
            place. By counting suicide, homicide, and accidents, it's easy to see how we are by far the worst
            prepetrators of our own demise. I suppose that's why we tend to view other groups as enemies. As Christians,
            however, we need to recognize the harm in such thinking. History is full of terrible examples of tribalized
            thinking resulting in death and suffering, from slavery, to genocide. When groups view other groups as
            enemies less worthy of respect and honor, then the natural fruit of such thinking is going to be death.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, I am not saying that we should naively embrace all people without fear. There are many people with
            darkness in their hearts that we need to be vigilant against, especially those who have embraced this 'us vs
            them' mentality. Yet these are precisely the type of people who need to understand the true fundamentals of
            Christianity, "love others as you would love yourself". This is especially true if it's so-called fellow
            Christians who have consciously or subconsciously embraced tribalism, there is nothing that harms the
            message of the Gospel worse than Christians who are demonizing and attacking groups of people who are share
            different values from them. "But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would
            be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the
            sea." - Matt 18:6.
          </p>
          <p>
            On somewhat related note, I have always wondered when "Christian Fundamentalist" came to carry such a
            negative connotation. I suppose that people tend to view a 'fundamentalist' as someone who is always lashing
            out against every other group they consider to be an 'enemy'. In a sense, that is so against the actual
            fundamentals of what Jesus taught that one has to wonder where things went wrong. Yes, we need to be careful
            about all the dangerous people out there, but just as Jesus prayed for forgiveness for those who crucified
            him, we too must also remember that even the worst of humanity is not our enemy.
