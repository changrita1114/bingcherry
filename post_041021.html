          <p>
            Almost everyone is familiar with 'Chicken Soup for the Soul', a series of books meant to encourage, comfort,
            and uplift us. In Chinese, there is something called 'Poisoned Chicken Soup Writings', which are rather dark
            essays written in the style of the aforementioned 'Chicken Soup', but with a sarcastic and critical flavor
            instead. The Chinese word 'du' means 'read', and there's a homynym that means 'poison'. Thus, the original
            'du ji tang wen', which, when translated word for word means 'read chicken soup writings' can easily be
            corrupted into 'poisoned chicken soup writings'.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, I would like to argue that it's very much a part of human nature to tear down, rebuke, and otherwise
            criticize things we don't like, and this isn't necessarily harmful. We certainly shouldn't be turning a
            blind eye to things that are causing problems in the world around us, and the Bible is rife with examples of
            rebukes meant to turn people away from behavior detestable in the eyes of God. There are arguments to be
            made that some positive writings can be quite harmful because they try to cover up rather than deal with the
            awful realities of the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, the Bible also exhorts us to use words that strengthen, comfort, and encourage people.
            There's a market for this in the secular world as well, as self help books and motivational speakers can
            make quite a living for themselves by encouraging others. At church, I recall a teaching on dealing with sin
            that has proven useful to me: "Instead of focusing on what you shouldn't be doing, focus on what you should
            be doing." It makes sense to me that this could be applied to whenever we make arguments on certain topics.
            While we may come across ideas and views that are abhorent to our own values, it might be more productive to
            demonstrate how our ideas are more benneficial as opposed to attacking the other side's beliefs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately though, I don't believe that this is a simple matter of stating whether it's better to build up
            or to tear down. Wisdom means choosing the right course of action at the right time, and I am sure we'll
            find times to encourage, and there will be times to rebuke. In all matters though, I believe that
            discernment is the key.
