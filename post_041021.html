            Regarding our physical bodies, everyone has at least some concept of what a healthy diet is. Eat plenty of
            fresh fruits and vegetables, avoid simple sugars, and keep consumption of overly processed foods down to a
            minimum. I personally consider it unfair that all the foods I love eating fall into the 'unhealthy'
            category, such as french fries, cheesecake, and donuts to name a few, but as far as injustices in the world
            go, this is a relatively trivial one. The same could be said about how we feed our spirits. I've certainly
            heard many a sermon on avoiding too much spiritual junk food, be it from television, social media, or video
            games. Of course, it's one thing to talk about healthy diets, both physical and spiritual, but it's another
            thing entirely to actually practice it.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a child, I certainly remember my parents working hard to ensure I eat a proper amount of healthy food,
            and avoid certain television programs and movies too. Unfortunately, in their zeal to protect me, they
            completely neglected the effect educational programs such as historical documentaries could have in
            traumatizing people. One of my very first memories was of one such documentary on Egyptian mummies, and even
            now I can remember the 5-year old me suffering many sleepless nights thinking about how terrifying death
            would be after watching those desiccated corpses on TV. People who knew me before I became Christian would
            often comment on my dark sense of humor, and I have that dull, but horrifying program to blame. Sometimes,
            it's not even obvious what types of programs could scar a child. I remember in Japan I met a mother who told
            me that her son became terrified after watching "Finding Nemo '', which seems like a completely innocuous
            kid's film. I'm definitely grateful that one of the first things I became healed of after accepting Christ
            was my fear of death.
          </p>

            Naturally, we want to do our best to keep people from consuming unhealthy material. Maybe you've heard
            people talk about 'Cancel Culture', which is a tactic employed by both the political right and left to rid
            what they consider offensive material. I don't think it's my place to criticize what people wish to
            'cancel', after all, nobody wants poisoned food to be sold as 'safe for consumption'. I'm confident there
            are many parents who try their hardest to restrict their children's consumption of junk food and junk media.
            Of course, I've been even more impressed by those who really go to the root of the problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            A wise person once told me that rather than focus on what we shouldn't do, we should put our energy into
            what we should. It's not possible to ban all junk food from the marketplace just as it's impossible to
            censor all forms of media we deem to be junk. If children can learn the concepts of healthy nutrition, they
            will be better able to control their junk food consumption far more than if we simply kept them away from
            eating any junk food. Without that foundation, a child who had been restricted in such a manner would
            probably lose all self control if ever they were free from the artificial barriers put in place by their
            parents. The same applies to the spiritual food that's consumed. While a safe shelter to protect children
            can serve some purpose, it is far better if the children are equipped with a solid foundation so that they
            don't fall into temptation once they are outside their shelter. The right and left don't just try to
            'cancel' what they don't like, they both strive to ingrain their principles into people's minds so that they
            will choose their side even when exposed to material contrary to would be deemed 'healthy'. Certainly the
            Bible exhorts parents to teach children properly so that they can discern what is good too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nutrition science, both of the physical and spiritual nature, is not as black and white as we'd like to
            think. In the physical world, there are a plethora of different diet plans, but we can judge their soundness
            by the 'fruit': a healthy body. Likewise, we can judge the fruit of the spiritual food consumed. Galatians
            5:22-23 teaches about the fruits of the spirit, serving as a good baseline for healthy 'spiritual
            nutrition': Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self control. If
            the fruit of any Christian material is making us less kind, this spiritual food is not healthy. If the fruit
            of our character is not becoming more Christ-like as we consume it, then we should be wary. I pray we all
            have that wisdom to discern the nutritional content of what we consume so that we can make healthy choices.
