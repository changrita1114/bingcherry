          <p>
            This week's article has become quite a pleasant surprise for me. I had started writing notes on Monday
            about my intended topic, the church, and during today's sermon the pastor spoke about the church. We
            Christians like to say that there are no coincidences, and this would be a prime example of that. As for
            church, I can't say much about others' experiences, but as someone who has been a believer for 17 years,
            the concept of church has been repeatedly explained to us as the gathering of believers, and not the
            building nor the organization that calls itself church. Of course, just in case a reader chances upon this
            article uncertain of our beliefs, the simple explanation is this: The Christian church exists whenever a
            body of Christians gather in Jesus' name.
          </p>
          <p>
            One disconcerting statistic I read about recently was that only 47% of people in the United States state
            that they still attend church, far lower than in times past. This worries me on two fronts, first, in the
            general sense that fewer people are gathering publicly to hear God's word. Secondly, this means that a
            very large number of people don't consider a gathering of believers, even as few as two people, to be
            church. Matthew 18:20 states clearly that Jesus is with us when two or three gather in His name, and I
            have met people who state they are Christian yet also say they don't attend 'church'.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can understand that organizations, even Christian ones, are imperfect and that there will be those who
            don't want a part of that. What is more concerning is when those claiming to be believers don't realize that
            it's not the participation in a Christian organization that matters, but this shouldn't stop believers from
            gathering together in small, personalized groups to share their faith and build each other up. In Acts
            20:20, it's clear that both the public gatherings of large groups and the house to house teaching are of
            importance in Christian life. Indeed there is no shortage of testimony from witnesses who experienced
            miraculous healings and deliverance at such gatherings, not to mention the generally useful teachings that
            can help us in our day to day lives. In other words, church in terms of small, personal gatherings with
            believers and large, public gatherings both are of importance for Christians.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regarding the decline in the number of Christians in this country, my first thoughts were that this was
            clearly not something that I was experiencing at the church I currently attend. To be honest, I don't
            consider this church to be a perfect place with perfect people, far from that in fact. Yet, I can see that
            this
            is a group of believers earnestly seeking God , following the core concept of 'love God and love others',
            and experiencing signs and wonders. I dare not accuse other churches of abandoning God, as I do not
            have personal experience with what has been happening in places where attendence is dropping. I will say
            that if churches have truly been following the principles of love while experiencing the miraculous work
            of the Holy Spirit, yet still experience decline, then we truly are living in scary times.
