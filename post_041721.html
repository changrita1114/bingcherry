          <p>
            I had a pleasant surprise just prior to writing this week's article. I had started writing notes on Monday
            about my intended topic, the church, and during today's sermon the pastor spoke about the church. We
            Christians like to say that there are no coincidences, and this would be a prime example of that. As for
            church, I can't say much about others' experiences, but as someone who has been a believer for 17 years, the
            concept of church has been repeatedly explained to us as the gathering of believers, and not the building
            nor the organization that calls itself church. Of course, just in case a reader chances upon this article
            uncertain of the term, the simple definition is this: The Christian church exists whenever a body of
            Christians gather in Jesus' name.
          </p>
          <p>
            One disconcerting statistic I read about recently was that only 47% of people in the United States state
            that they still attend church, far lower than in times past. They were referring to the religious attendance
            of all types, but it can easily be inferred that church attendance among Christians would be part of this
            statistic. This worries me on two fronts, first, in the general sense that fewer people are gathering in the
            conventional sense of church. Secondly, I am concerned that a very large number of people don't consider a
            gathering of believers, even as few as two people, to be a church. Matthew 18:20 states clearly that Jesus
            is with us when two or three gather in His name, yet I have met people who state they are Christian yet also
            say they don't attend 'church'. This would indicate that they either aren't aware that all it takes to
            attend church is find one other person to gather with them in Jesus' name, or that they consider even such a
            step to be too much of a bother in their daily lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Acts 20:20, it's clear that both the public gatherings of large groups and the house to house teaching
            are of importance in Christian life. Indeed there is no shortage of testimony from witnesses who experienced
            miraculous healings and deliverance from either type of gathering, not to mention all the practical
            teachings to help us through our daily lives. In other words, church in terms of small, personal gatherings
            with believers and large, public gatherings both are of importance for Christians. It's understandable that
            many people might distrust large gatherings, and thus are reluctant about joining one of these types of
            churches, and a small gathering among Christians is also a gathering of imperfect sinners, and with that
            comes all the risks associated with such people meeting together. Nevertheless, there's the old saying
            'nothing ventured, nothing gained', and I believe that the benefits of gathering with other believers far
            outweigh the risks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regarding the decline in the number of Christians in this country, my first thoughts were that this was
            clearly not something that I was experiencing at the church I currently attend. To be honest, my
            interactions with the body of Christ have mostly been positive, so in some ways it's rather difficult for me
            to emphasize with those who are reluctant to attend church. Yet, I dare not accuse other churches of
            abandoning God, as I do not have personal experience with what has been happening in places where attendance
            is dropping. Gatherings are one of the ways God's power is demonstrated, both in signs and wonders, and also
            through life transformations. Scripture encourages us not to stop gathering, and with the help of modern
            technology, it's far easier than before to find and connect with other members of the body of Christ, in
            large or small groups. Furthermore, for those Christians who are living together with at least one other
            believer, there's really no excuse not to gather together as a church in that sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            My hope is that the decline in church attendance is really a decline in the traditional concept of what
            church attendance means, the idea that meeting for Sunday (or sometimes Saturday) equates to being a
            Christian. Being Christian means far more than that, and I would encourage any believer, even those who
            still gather for weekend services to think more deeply about that. For those who have stopped gathering, I
            pray that you find Christian gatherings that can help you build up and live out a fruitful spiritual life.
