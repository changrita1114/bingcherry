          <p>
            I've been asked by some people the question: "Why should I believe in God?" The textbook answer
            sounds simple enough, it's because we can re-establish a relationship with God and spend eternity in
            paradise, free from the tortures of Hell. One might also add that it's because God is real, and that He
            really
            loves us. Of course, while these answers are certainly Biblically correct, they may feel very intangible and
            not necessarily persuasive for some. It got me thinking about the messages I often heard preached when I
            first became a Christian.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the very first church I attended, there was often a teaching about how, once you became Christian, you
            would see many outward signs of God's blessings. Your relationships with people would improve, you
            would enjoy abundant good health, and you would see some degree of financial success. By now, most
            people are familiar with the 'Prosperity Gospel', and the church I attended would frequently reference
            certain American televangelists to justify the legitmacy of this doctrine. On the other hand, there are
            certainly plenty of Christians who have spoken out against this doctrine, and people need to look no
            further than Jesus and Paul for counterexamples in the Bible. However, I'm not here to join in the bashing
            of the 'Prosperity Gospel'. While I disagree with it on many levels, I understand the appeal: "You should
            believe in God because you will be blessed."
          </p>
          <p>
            Another important principle of Christian life is the suffering we must endure for Jesus. The Lord himself
            spoke in length on the different types of persecution and turmoil Christians would face for believing in
            Him. Even in the old Testament, we can find plenty of examples, like the prophets who lived in the times
            of corrupt kings, and of the righteous suffering under the heavy arm of the wicked in general. Suffice to
            say, this is not exactly the most appealing message to hear for some people, but it's certainly doctrinally
            sound. Interestingly enough, this was also a message frequently preached at that same church I attended.
            You would think that the messages of suffering and prosperity would be incompatible with each other,
            and indeed there are those who feel as though their life became filled with nothing but trouble since they
            believed in God.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a very practical standpoint, whether Christian or not, people shall experience both prosperity and
            suffering throughout their lifetime to varying degrees. In a very natural, human way, a Christian who
            follows God's teachings on love and integrity could see some real life bennefits: people will be drawn to
            them, and their kindness and honesty at work or in business results in financial success. Unfortunately,
            it's
            also natural that for some, becoming Christian will cause ruptures in relationships with friends and
            family, and there will be times that sincerely following Christ's principles result in financial hardship.
            There is a fundamental problem here, which is when we look at the outward results at all. 1 Samuel 16:7
            says that man looks at the outward appearance, but God sees the heart. The promise of outward blessings
            should not entice us, nor should the suffering dissuade us from following God.
          </p>
          <p>
            Going back to the original question, "why should we believe in God?", I realize that I would need to dig
            further than the 'textbook answer'. Why is someone asking this question? Do they put their hope in God
            providing physical, tangible rewards? Or are they afraid that by believing in God, they will have to join in
            the suffering? Good and bad things happen to good and bad people, and not respectively like many would
            hope. 1 Corinthians 15:19 says very clearly that if we're only hoping for Christ in this life, then we are
            to
            be pitied (sometimes translated to mean 'we are the most miserable'). The world we live in now is so very
            flawed, and to be honest, whether you are Christian or not, if this world is where we are putting our
            hopes, then prepare to be disappointed. Yet if you are hoping that there is something far greater, and
            eternal, then you should believe in God.
