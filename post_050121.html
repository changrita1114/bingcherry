          <p>
            If you're Christian, you've probably heard many times that God has a special purpose or destiny for us.
            We hear about people getting called into the mission field, called to the workplace, called to build
            churches, etc. These are all noble pursuits and also topics that won't be covered by me. I remember that
            one of my first lessons at my church's school was about God caring more about who we are than about
            what we do. Indeed we should always be seeking out God to discern what He wants us to do, but the key
            to God's calling lies in something far more basic and simple.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two principles that are easy to remember, but really fundamental to Christians. First is the most
            important commandent, to love God and love people. Second, that God rewards us based on our faith, not
            works. 1 Corinthians 13: 1-3 is essentially saying that our actions should always come from a heart of
            love, otherwise the miracles we perform and the good works we do will be for naught. Wherever God
            calls us, and for whatever purpose He wants us there, it's important to not lose sight of this. Even
            non-believers have a purpose, just look at Nebuchanezzar and Cyrus. They were pagan rulers used by God for
            very important purposes, but few would argue that they were considered great examples of righteousness
            for us to follow.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second part is more interesting. We have heard people say that God rewards us for what we have
            done. Salvation by faith, sanctification through works is a common teaching. There's always that danger
            of misunderstanding this as some sort of 'karma': that once we become Christians, we somehow must
            perform a quota of faithful actions in order to receive a better reward from God. At the churches I have
            gone to, the pastors were always saying that the difference between Christianity and other religions is that
            Christianity focuses on relationship and grace, while other religions are all about earning their god's
            favor by effort. If Christians also have to perform works to earn God's favor, then how is our faith
            different
            from that of a non-Christian? Obviously, we need to go back to 1 Corinthians 13, and then that saying
            about God caring more about who we are than about what we do makes sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            Living out God's purpose for us can only come from a relationship with God built on faith and love.
            Whatever our calling might be, it is simply a means to that end. Performing signs and wonders, serving
            the poor, spreading the gospel, caring for our neighbors, the list goes on and on. All of these are outward
            signs of a faith filled life. At least, I pray that we can live our lives in that way. When we go out and do
            what God wants
            us to do, never lose sight of the person God wants us to be.
