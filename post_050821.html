          <p>
            I recently read an article about a woman who defied her family's tradition by wearing pants. The biblical
            basis for this was found in Deuteronomy 22:5, "A woman should not wear men's clothing, nor a man, women's
            clothing.." and I started to think more about Christian faith. There are so many Christian denominations,
            and some groups, such as Mormons and Jehova's Witnesses, are essentially recognized as heretics because of
            their beliefs. In a previous article, I had written that how we interpret information will determine our
            beliefs, and of course this applies all the more so to reading scripture. While I cannot say that I am the
            foremost authority on interpreting scripture, maybe some of my thoughts might prove useful for those with
            differing opinions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rupertus Meldenius is quoted as saying "In essentials, unity, in non-essentials, liberty, and in all things,
            charity." While the saying is nearly 400 years old, it is still relevant today, especially considering how
            differently Christians interpret the Bible. This also includes which parts are given more emphasis.
            Methodists, Baptists, Lutherans, Anglicans, Calvinists, etc... these are just a few examples of the major
            denominations people hear of. Then there are various movements, such as the early Christians who adopted
            vegetarianism and the modern Quiverfull movement which encourages families to bear as many children as
            possible. If a Christian group is large enough, there will be some loud voices attacking them, often coming
            from other Christians. As far as I can tell, these different groups all share the same 'essentials', that
            salvation is through faith in Jesus as our Lord and savior, but in the 'non-essential' details they all have
            differing views. It's no wonder Meldenius urged charity and liberty.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I'm not saying is that we should simply condone beliefs that are unbiblical. I would strongly disagree
            with Christians who insist that women should not wear pants and would not hesistate to express this opinion
            to anyone who asked me. However, what I've learned is that dwelling on differences is not necessarily the
            most fruitful way of living life. A good tree bears good fruit, and from my own experience, one way to NOT
            bear good fruit is to be attacking fellow Christians rather than showing charity in all things. If there's
            any baseline that Christians can look to, I would argue that God's commandment on love and the Gospel should
            be where our unity lies, and matters like wearing pants, should not cause division among believers.
          </p>
          <p>
            What, specifically, am I referring to when I write about love and the Gospel? Let's first look at love as an
            example. The further away a principle or ideology is from loving people and God, the more we should look
            upon it with caution. One specific example would be slavery. In the past, people used the biblical examples
            of slavery to justify enslaving people, and yet today it would be exceptionally difficult to find people who
            consider this an acceptable Christian practice. The more the message focuses on effort and good works, thus
            straying from the Gospel, the less trust we should put in that message. We've heard it said that the devil
            is in the details, and indeed Christians squabble a lot over scriptural details. That's unavoidable, I fear,
            but I pray that we do not lose sight of the Spirit of God's words when discussing the minutiae of it.
