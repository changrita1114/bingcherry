            I recently read an article about a woman who defied her family's tradition by wearing pants. If you're
            wondering what kind of family would be against women wearing pants, their biblical basis was found in
            Deuteronomy 22:5, "A woman should not wear men's clothing, nor a man, women's clothing..". She ultimately
            came to the conclusion that there was nothing against the Bible specifically forbidding women from wearing
            pants. Personally, I'd argue that there was also no biblical verse specifying that pants were definitively
            clothing that only men could wear. In a previous article, I had written that how we interpret information
            will determine our beliefs, and of course this applies all the more so to reading scripture. While I cannot
            say that I am the foremost authority on interpreting scripture, maybe some of my thoughts might prove useful
            for those with differing opinions.

            Rupertus Meldenius is quoted as saying "In essentials, unity, in non-essentials, liberty, and in all things,
            charity." While the saying is nearly 400 years old, it is still relevant today, especially considering how
            differently Christians interpret the Bible. This also includes which parts are given more emphasis.
            Methodists, Baptists, Lutherans, Anglicans, Calvinists, etc... these are just a few examples of the major
            denominations people hear of. Then there are various movements, such as the vegetarian early Christians
            mentioned in the Bible and the modern Quiverfull movement which encourages families to produce as many
            children as possible. If a Christian group is large enough, there will be some loud voices attacking them,
            often coming from other Christians. With all these different views on various aspects of the Bible, it's no
            wonder Meldenius urged charity.

            What I'm not saying is that we should simply condone beliefs that are unbiblical. I would strongly disagree
            with Christians who insist that women should not wear pants, and despite my Baptist background, I strongly
            disagree with some details on how they handle baptisms. What I've learned is that dwelling on these
            differences is not necessarily the most fruitful way of living life. A good tree bears good fruit, and from
            my own experience, one way to NOT bear good fruit is to be attacking people rather than showing charity in
            all things. In a previous article, I had written that we should respect people even when disagreeing with
            their beliefs, certainly that would include other Christians. If there's any baseline that Christians can
            look to, I would argue that God's commandment on love and the Gospel should be where our unity lies, and
            that everything else should be measured against these two fundamentals.
          <p>
            What, specifically, am I referring to when I write about love and the Gospel? Let's first look at love as an
            example. The further away a principle or ideology is from loving people and God, the more we should look
            upon it with caution. One specific example would be slavery. In the past, people used the biblical examples
            of slavery to justify enslaving people, and yet today it would be exceptionally difficult to find people who
            consider this an acceptable Christian practice. Another example is regarding grace versus striving. The more
            the message focuses on effort and good works, thus straying from the Gospel, the less trust we should put in
            that message. Galatians 5:22-23 is about the fruits of the Holy Spirit, and also serves as another basis for
            determining how well we are interpreting the scripture. Is the interpretation helping us produce the fruit
            described in those verses?
          </p>
          <p>
            I recall a conversation I had with a non-Christian about faith. He said that it didn't matter what you
            believed, but rather how you believed. While I disagree with him on the former part, I cannot deny the
            latter. We see a great deal of terrifying fruit come from a lack of understanding, or incorrect
            understanding of the Bible, such as racism, oppression, legalism, and misogyny to name a few. Then there is
            the squabbling over trivial matters such as clothing, hair styles, and even the types of instruments and
            music used in worship. We've heard it said that the devil is in the details, and indeed Christians squabble
            a lot over scriptural details. That's unavoidable, I fear, but I pray that we not lose sight of the Spirit
            of God's words when discussing the minutiae of it.
