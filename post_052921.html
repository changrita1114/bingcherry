            Today, at home my partner and I had a light hearted conversation on animal purring. We both knew that cats
            purred when they felt relaxed and content, but with the help of a quick Google search, we soon discovered
            that many other animals also purred. One of those, the bear, really caught my attention. There's something
            very soothing about listening to the low rumbling, engine-like sound of a bear purr. Isaiah 11:7 says that
            the bear and cow will feed together, and my mental image of that is now of a combination of moos and engine
            purrs working in harmony. While the Bible does not dwell too much on nature and animals, there are still
            some significant verses to note.
          </p>
          <p>
            "But ask the beasts, and they will teach you; the birds of the heavens, and they will tell you; or the
            bushes of the earth, and they will teach you; and the fish of the sea will declare to you. Who among all
            these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this? In his hand is the life of every living thing
            and the breath of all mankind." Job 12:7-10
          </p>
          <p>
            I've often heard the saying 'all dogs go to heaven', and while I cannot say for certain that this is a
            biblically sound statement, it's hard to deny the merits. After all, the beasts know about what God has done
            and are dogs not considered to be beasts? Looking back at Isaiah 11:6-9 we see that God's prophet is saying
            that all creatures shall live together in harmony, not just humans. We know animals were in the Garden of
            Eden before the fall, and that they were obviously not there as food since, prior to the fall, God had only
            provided the plants as food. There's a certain bond that we have with animals, and one might argue that the
            pets we keep now are a reflection of the animal friendship we will enjoy in the kingdom of God.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then there's the topic of plants that I also want to cover. It's interesting to note that in Job 12, it also
            mentions that the bushes of the earth will teach us about God. In our imperfect world, we continually
            struggle greatly to strike a balance between nature and civilization, and it seems like protection of one
            comes at the cost of the other. Even popular culture often depicts heaven as this place in the clouds devoid
            of any greenery. Yet it appears that if God is making a new heaven and a new earth, it stands to reason that
            we'll see all the greatness of nature there too, not just fluffy clouds and sparkling gates. I would imagine
            that the new earth would be one where humans and plants once again live harmoniously.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not advocating all Christians to become environmentalists, and indeed in terms of environmental
            consciousness I pale in comparison to many who follow the 'green movement'. Ultimately though, our love of
            nature is another reflection of the principles of Christian love, for both people and God. By reducing the
            amount of pollution we create and protecting the environment, others can live better and have more.
            Appreciation of nature, to me, is another one of the ways we can worship and praise the Lord, indeed, this
            type of praise is found in numerous passages in the Bible. How much more so should we praise God when we do
            so with the knowledge that whatever wonders we see now will pale in comparison to what He has planned?
