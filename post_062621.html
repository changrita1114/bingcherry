          <p>
            Before diving into cultural warfare, I think that we should first review some key phrases in the Bible:
            Ephesians 6:12 says 'For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the
            authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in
            the heavenly places.' 2 Corinthians 10:3-5 says 'For though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war
            according to the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy
            strongholds. We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take
            every thought captive to obey Christ.' There are many ideas that are antithetical to Christian culture, and
            I would argue that it's very much within human nature to respond by trying to fight them. The Bible tells us
            that 'we are not waging war according to the flesh.', and in my mind that should be the end of the
            discussion. Yes, there is a powerful stronghold of anti-Christian ideology, but we are doing Christ a
            disservice trying to engage the world in culture wars. Such behavior is using human ways to fight against
            flesh and blood, while failing to actually live out God's calling for us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's look at this from a practical standpoint first. In 1 Corinthians 2:1-4 Paul says 'And so it was with
            me, brothers and sisters. When I came to you, I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed
            to you the testimony about God. For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and
            him crucified. I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling. My message and my preaching were not
            with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit’s power.' Jesus commissioned
            Christians to go make disciples, not to win worldly arguments regarding Christian culture using 'persuasive
            words'. I can still remember that prior to accepting Christ, I had heard many Christians arguing about
            Christian culture, and not a single bit of it had an impact on my beliefs. In fact, it only made Christian
            culture appear more repulsive. True persuasion comes from spreading the message of Jesus Christ's message of
            redemption through crucifixion. We could cancel every single piece of anti-Christian culture and counter
            every argument against us, yet completely fail God's commission.
          </p>
          <p>
            There might be a misguided belief that by fighting against worldly culture, we can spread Christian morality
            and ethics to more people, thereby bringing about improvement in society as a whole. Yet I'm reminded of
            this verse from Romans 2:4 'Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and
            patience, not realizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance? ' We have a limited
            amount of time and energy, therefore it would be better if we used these resources to demonstrate the power
            and love of God, thus leading people to Christ, as opposed to using our flesh and blood to fight back
            against the tide of anti-Christian culture.
